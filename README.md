# PART 2 — About renaming LICENSE → LICENSE.md (You’re OK)

You wrote:

> “Update and rename LICENSE to LICENSE.md”

✅ **That is valid and supported by GitHub**

GitHub recognizes:
- `LICENSE`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `LICENSE.txt`

So you did **nothing wrong**.

---

## ✅ Multiple licenses (correct way with LICENSE.md)

Inside `LICENSE.md`:

```md
# License

This project is dual-licensed under:

- MIT License
- Apache License 2.0

You may choose either license.
